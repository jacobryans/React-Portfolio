            <h2>I'm Jacob, a full stack web developer with experience crafting wonderful projects from conceptualization to finalization. I work primarily with React on front end and Java/Node on the back end but I am always up for new challenges and opportunities to learn. I take my time to ensure that my code is clean, efficient, testable and understandable for the next developer and myself. As a quick learner and experienced project manager, I enjoy working on all forms of projects that can push me to become a better developer.</h2>
